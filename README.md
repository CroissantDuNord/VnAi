# VnAi ()
An experimental AI based visual novel. Also just a way for me to learn pygame and the "OpenAI" (With Local Model) API

# Why
- **Free**, **No API Key** is required everything is on your computer
- **Tiny**, Its simple, but fast

# How to use 
## WIP (DO NOT USE)
1. Install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
2. Download any model _(Pygmalion 12b/7b recommended)_ in the search tab
3. Open the Local Inference Server Tab, **Chose Zephyr as the present!** (If pygmalion)
